# Beveridge Curve
The Beveridge Curve is a graph mapping the efficency of a labor market. There is an inverse relationship between unemployment and job vancancies. For example, an increase in unemployment will lead to a decrease in available jobs cooling wage driven inflation in a labor market. The Federal Reserve considers this relationship when the labor market is too tight or unstimualted. This dynamic was captured in the 'soft landing' the Federal Reserve facillitated by raising the federal funds rate after the Covid-19 Recession.
